# Lol Simple v2.4.3 (64-bit)

Purpose
============================
I barely understand C++ (which is why I don't know how to make the 
32-bit version :pensive:), however, I know Java really well. 
I used basic C++ to read from and write to, League of Legends.
Most of the work went into putting it all together in Java.
I started this project mainly to understand more about design
patterns in OOP languages (plus I always wanted to make zoom 
for League :stuck_out_tongue:). Feel free to comment on
how I can do better, God knows I made a ton of mistakes.
Anyways, here are all the features.

**Auto Minion Kill**                                                                                                     |
**Set a Macro on your health** (I didn't finish this one all the way, however, you can see your health :smile:)          |
