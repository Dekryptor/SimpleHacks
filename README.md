I didn't completely finish this because I got bored.

**PLEASE NOTE**  
The MainJNI.cpp file will need to be updated with more recent
pointers. These can be easily found using cheat engine. If you
need help finding them, message me via email. Once you update
the new values, you must create a shared dll from this file.

# Lol Simple v2.4.3 (64-bit)

Purpose
============================
I barely understand C++ (which is why I don't know how to make the 
32-bit version :pensive:), however, I know Java really well. 
I used basic C++ to read from and write to, League of Legends.
Most of the work went into putting it all together in Java.
I started this project mainly to understand more about design
patterns in OOP languages (plus I always wanted to make zoom 
for League :stuck_out_tongue:). Feel free to comment on
how I can do better, God knows I made a ton of mistakes.
Anyways, here are all the features.

**Zoom Hack** (You can zoom out as much as you like)	                                                                 |
**Auto Minion Kill**                                                                                                     |
**Set a Macro on your health** (I didn't finish this one all the way, however, you can see your health :smile:)          |
